# Illustrator Text to Bounding Rectangles Script

This Adobe Illustrator script creates bounding rectangles around each line of a selected text frame.
It's useful for quickly writing up some text, and visualising it in a neat layout.

## Features

- Generates a separate rectangle for each line of text.
- Adjusts rectangle width based on the number of characters in the line.
- Sets default colour based on the text colour.
- Skips empty lines (e.g., line breaks between paragraphs).
- Adjusts the starting position of the rectangle based on leading whitespace.
- Creates rounded rectangles for a visually appealing representation.

## Usage

> :warning: **Warning**: It is advised to use a monospaced font to ensure accurate bounding rectangle dimensions.

1. Open an Adobe Illustrator project.
2. Select the text frame you want to create bounding rectangles for.
3. Run this script (`File > Scripts > Other Script...`) and select this script file.
4. Enjoy!
